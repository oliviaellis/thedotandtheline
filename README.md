# thedotandtheline
Based on the short story by Norman Juster and the 1965 MGM animated short.

The Dot and the Line is a game I built with the Phaser 2 library for JavaScript. It is the first draft of what I hope to turn into a robust interactive storytelling experience.

Play the game at http://thedotandtheline.herokuapp.com! Use the up/down arrow keys and the spacebar to play.
Make sure to turn your sound on!
